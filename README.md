> Easy-install for SoftEtherVPN (only on Ubuntu)
> 
> #### FOR AMD / INTEL CPU
> ```bash
> wget -O se-install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pink210/softether-easyinstall/master/install-ubuntu-inteloramd.bash  && chmod +x se-install && ./se-install
> ```
> #### FOR ARMS64 CPU

> This script is just a one-click install of [SoftEtherVPN_Stable].
> 
> All credit is going to [Daiyuu Nobori] for making this beautiful software. THANK YOU!
> 
> This script also updates your Linux so you don't have to and also installs certbot for domain certificate and ncat and net-tools for useful software. 
> This script also can get certbot for your domain automatically so you sit back and enjoy installing :)
> 
> This script also opens ports 22, 53, 2280, 2380, 443, 80, 992, 1194, 2080, 5555, 4500, 1701, 500, 8280, 500, 4500, 8280, 53/udp. I know opening that much of ports is not good but I need it so ... You can simply close it with 
> ```bash
> sudo ufw deny PORT
> ```
> For setting SoftEtherVPN:
> ```bash
> sudo /opt/softether/vpncmd 127.0.0.1:5555
> ```
> No need to set password in SoftEtherVPN setting. You can do it with SoftEther VPN Server Manager (Windows) later.
