To install the script, simply copy and paste it on your Linux server in terminal
  
#### FOR AMD / INTEL CPU
```bash
wget -O se-install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pink210/softether-easyinstall/master/install-ubuntu-inteloramd.bash  && chmod +x se-install && ./se-install
```
#### FOR ARMS64 CPU
```bash
wget -O se-install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pink210/softether-easyinstall/master/install-ubuntu-arms.bash  && chmod +x se-install && ./se-install
```

There is no need to configure SoftEtherVPN with a password. Later, you can use SoftEther VPN Server Manager (Windows).
To use this script, you need to have root privileges or be able to run commands with sudo.
The script will ask you for confirmation before proceeding with the installation. It will also ask you if you want to set up a certificate from Let's Encrypt and if you want to enter the SoftEther VPN Server settings.
The installation process may take several minutes depending on your system and network speed. After the installation is complete, you can use the vpncmd tool to configure your VPN server. For more information on how to use vpncmd, please refer to the [official documentation](https://www.softether.org/4-docs/1-manual/6._Command_Line_Management_Utility_Manual).
